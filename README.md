# human_body_joint_tracking
This repository contains software code to track various human body joints in low resolution video given the human pose at each frame. The tracking is important to get more accurate locations of the joint position similar to that obtained with MoCAP data for further gait analysis. Various popular descriptors in OpenCV are used such as SIFT, SURF, BRIEF, along with HOG and LBP descriptors.
